# epn-test.pm
# version 0.01
# July 2018 [v0.01]
#
# This file explains some aspects of the epn-test.pm module.
# 
# epn-test.pm requires that epn-options.pm and epn-ofile.pm also
# be installed and in the user's PERL5LIB:
#
# https://github.com/nawrockie/epn-options.git
# https://github.com/nawrockie/epn-ofile.git
#
# The comments in epn-test.pm are currently the only documentation
# for this module. For an example of usage, see ribotyper-v1, which
# is, as of this writing, the only package that uses epn-test.pm:
#
# https://github.com/nawrockie/ribotyper-v1.git
